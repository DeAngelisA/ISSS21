## Get support
If you need support with the problem sets you can interact with the rest of the clas (and me) using GitHub issues. Learn more about GitHub issues [at this link](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Click the "issues" button to see them all. You can create a new issue for anything: difficulties developing R code, to share useful resources/links with the rest of the class, to get support wiht the problem sets and the final assignment.  
**Important**: supporting each other is allowed and encouraged, but it is *not allowed to provide direct answers* to the exercises in the problem sets nor directly share code that can be re-used (read the section "Academic integrity and collaboration" on the course syllabus).
